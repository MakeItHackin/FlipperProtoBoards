## DESCRIPTION:  
This pack of prototyping boards includes a one-of-a-kind board that allows you to directly transfer your solderless breadboard project to a PCB to be mounted on the Flipper Zero.  The half-size breadboard has a lot of room for various components and allows you to modify your project with ease!  This breadboard is setup so that it mimics a solderless breadboard, which means the columns are electrically connected and the top and bottom rows are configured with positive and ground rows.  You choose whether to use the 3.3V or 5V power bus from the Flipper by soldering the pads on the front.  

Also included are one small and one large prototyping boards with regularly separated/non-connected pads with a pitch of 2.54mm.  

Right-angle pin headers are included for each board and one 40-pin straight pin male header is included in case you want to configure a board to use straight pins.  

Stickers are included as well!

In the pictures, a Flipper Zero and various electronic components are shown for reference only.  They are not included with this bundle.  The bundle includes the prototyping boards, pin headers, and stickers.
